# Topmate Services Program

This program fetches all the services by input Topmate profile and builds a new page to show all the services.

## Program Requirements

The program should be able to:
- Fetch all the services by input Topmate profile
- Build a new page to show all the services

## Program Implementation

The program is implemented using the following technologies and steps:
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose
  - Sets up an Express server to handle HTTP requests
  - Connects to MongoDB using Mongoose to store and retrieve services
- Frontend: React
  - Renders a page to display the services fetched from the backend API
- MERN Stack: Combines the backend and frontend technologies to create a full-stack application

## Getting Started

To run the program locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/topmate-services-program.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   - Navigate to the project directory:
     ```
     cd topmate-services-program
     ```
   - Install backend dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
   - Navigate to the client directory:
     ```
     cd client
     ```
   - Install frontend dependencies:
     ```
     npm install
     ```

3. Set up MongoDB:
   - Install MongoDB if you haven't already: [MongoDB Installation Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
   - Start MongoDB service: [MongoDB Starting and Stopping Guide](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/manage-mongodb-processes/)

4. Configure the MongoDB connection:
   - Open the `server.js` file in the project root directory.
   - Replace the MongoDB connection string with your own connection details.

5. Run the program:
   - In the project root directory, start the backend server:
     ```
     npm start
     ```
   - In a separate terminal, navigate to the client directory:
     ```
     cd client
     ```
   - Start the frontend development server:
     ```
     npm start
     ```

6. Access the application:
   - Open a web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to see the application.
   - Enter the Topmate profile URL to fetch and display the services.

## Notes

- This program is a simplified implementation and may require additional enhancements and error handling for production use.
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection to fetch services from the Topmate profile.
